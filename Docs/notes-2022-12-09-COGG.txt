== COGG ==

the notes need to be distinct from each other depending on who made it

add in instructions that you actually need to follow

allow undoing initial edits before unobfuscators

make the notes not auto-update while editing? or pause updating? some ppl like to read original note while editing in the notebook

make it easier to move the notebook around

instead of insta-unobfuscate, make buttons unobfuscate one word at a time


== mixup ==

do concept art for the environment

add landmarks: trrehouse, benches, boxes
